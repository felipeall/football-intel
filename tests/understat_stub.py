"""A synthetic Understat. No scraped data (ADR 4): every value is made up.

Season 2024 (24/25) lists three fixtures: Matches 1 and 2 were played, 3 was not. Season
2025 (25/26) lists Match 4, played. Season 2026 has no data: 404. Match 2's data answers
404 although the league data lists it as played. Like Understat, every request without
`X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` answers 404 with an HTML page.
