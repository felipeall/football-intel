"""`httpx` transports that store and replay a source's Raw Responses (ADR 4, ADR 28).

`RecordingTransport` stores each response as a Raw Response before the caller sees it, and
answers from a fresh stored one instead when it can; `ReplayTransport` answers from stored
Raw Responses and never touches the network. Both are source-neutral: each source passes its
name, and the recording transport its failure test.

The recording transport wraps the source interface's transport, so it sees every upstream
request the interface handles, and records exactly one Fetch Attempt for each.
