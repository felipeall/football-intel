"""Sofascore's Captcha Token (ADR 30).

Sofascore answers API requests with its bot challenge until a Turnstile captcha is solved and
the solution exchanged for a Captcha Token. The token is bound to the client that exchanges
it, so a browser only produces the Turnstile response and the impersonating transport, which
sends every request, exchanges it.

`CaptchaTransport` sits between the source interface and the impersonating transport. It
sends each request with the current token, or without one when there is none. A challenged
answer makes it obtain a token from the `TokenProvider` and send the request once more. A
request without a token is the plain probe ADR 30 asks for: while Sofascore does not
challenge, no browser is launched.

The exchange and the resend bypass the rate limit and are not recorded: the exchange's answer
is the token itself, and there are at most a few of them an hour. The recorded answer is the
last one.
