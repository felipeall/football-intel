# AGENTS.md

Football data platform: Temporal ingestion from scraped sources into Postgres, dbt transforms, and a Claude scouting agent served over MCP.

## Read before working

- `GLOSSARY.md` — the domain glossary. Name code, tables and tests with its terms (Player, Source Record, Raw Response, Appearance, Action, Style Profile…).
- `docs/adr/` — accepted decisions. Read the ADRs touching your area before changing it; a change that contradicts one needs a new ADR first.
- `docs/agent-skills.md` — vendor skills enabled for this repo (Temporal, Pydantic, Langfuse, …). Load the matching skill before working with that technology; add new ones by its checklist.

## Rules the code does not show

- Store every source response as a Raw Response before parsing it, so parsers can be re-run without re-fetching.
- Every source goes through the common source interface, which owns rate limits, retries and the circuit breaker.
- Keep secrets in `.env` only. Strip credentials from URLs before logging or storing them.
- Scraped data lives under `data/` or in the database, both outside version control.
- Temporal workflows stay deterministic: all I/O (HTTP, database, LLM calls) runs in activities.
- The agent is provider-neutral (ADR 24): core code talks to the `AgentRunner` and `LLMClient` ports and imports provider SDKs only inside `agent/providers/<provider>/`.
- Pick models by Model Role through configuration; model IDs live in configuration only.
- A new provider is done when it passes the shared runner conformance suite.
- Chat runs the runner directly; Temporal is for ingestion and long-running jobs.
- A new domain term goes into `GLOSSARY.md` in the same change.
- Langfuse runs v4 in events-only mode: read traces through the v2 Observations API (`/api/public/v2/observations`); the legacy `/api/public/traces` endpoints answer with an error.

## Critical review

Two gates. Each ends in a written verdict, and the work moves on only after it.

1. **Before implementing an issue, or accepting a new ADR: pre-mortem.** Assume the design shipped and failed, and find why. Check every assumption the issue and its ADRs rest on against what the code, live runs and other ADRs now show, and look for a smaller design that meets the same acceptance criteria. Post the pre-mortem as a comment on the issue (on the pull request for a new ADR): each finding with its evidence, then a verdict — *proceed*, *proceed with changes* (listed), or *needs a new ADR*. On *needs a new ADR*, stop and ask the user.
2. **Before asking to merge a pull request: review the full diff** against the issue's acceptance criteria and the ADRs — correctness, outcomes the tests leave unpinned, docs and glossary drift. Fix each finding, or list it under **Open questions** in the pull request body. The gate is done when every finding is fixed or listed.

## Commits

[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/): `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.

- **description**: imperative, lowercase, no trailing period, ≤ 72 characters (`add sofascore lineups activity`).
- **body**: explains *why* when the subject does not; wrapped at 72 characters.
- **footers**: `Refs: ADR-0006`, `BREAKING CHANGE: <what changed and how to migrate>`. Breaking changes also take `!` after the type or scope.
- **types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs` (README, ADRs, `GLOSSARY.md`), `refactor`, `perf`, `test` (tests and evals), `build` (dependencies, packaging, Docker images), `ci`, `chore` (touches no source or test code), `revert`.
- **scopes**: `sources`, `transfermarkt`, `sofascore`, `understat`, `workflows`, `identity`, `dbt`, `profiles`, `agent`, `mcp`, `evals`, `web`, `infra`, `skills`. Omit the scope when a change spans several areas.

## Decisions

- Every architectural decision gets an ADR in `docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md` and a line in `docs/adr/README.md`.
- To supersede a decision, write a new ADR and set the old one's status to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.

## Branches and pull requests

- `main` is always releasable. One branch per change, named `<type>/<short-description>` (`feat/sofascore-heatmaps`), branched from `main`.
- Pull request titles follow the commit format; squash-merge, so the title becomes the commit on `main`.
- Open one pull request at a time, and start dependent work once it has merged.
- When a pull request must build on an unmerged one, retarget it to `main` (`gh pr edit <n> --base main`) before merging its base. Squash-merging with `--delete-branch` closes every pull request still based on the deleted branch, and GitHub refuses to reopen one whose branch was force-pushed since.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `ruff`, `pyright`, `pytest`, `import-linter` and `gitleaks` on every pull request and push to `main`. Merge only with all of them green, read from the run on the pull request's current head commit (`gh run list --branch <branch>`); a rebase or force-push starts a new run.
- The repository is private on a free plan: branch protection and rulesets answer 403, so GitHub enforces no required checks (#1).
- Write `Closes #N` only in pull request bodies: in a commit pushed straight to `main` it closes the issue on push, before its remaining criteria are met. After `gh issue reopen`, confirm the state with `gh issue view`.

## Progress

Work is tracked in GitHub Issues, one GitHub milestone per roadmap milestone (M1–M7).

- At session start: read the open issues of the current milestone (`gh issue list --milestone "<title>"`) and the latest comment on the issue you pick up.
- At session end: comment on that issue with what was done, what is next, and any blockers.
- Pull requests close their issues (`Closes #N`). When a milestone closes, update its row in the README roadmap.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on `felipeall/football-intel`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
