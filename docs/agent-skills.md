# Agent skills

Official vendor skills that help coding agents work with this stack. Decision and rules: [ADR 26](adr/0026-agent-skills.md).

Skills are enabled just in time — at the start of the milestone that needs them — so every conversation carries only the skill descriptions it can use.

## Adding or updating a skill

1. Install only from the vendor's own repository, never from a directory listing or copy.
2. Read the `SKILL.md`, its references, and any `hooks/`, `.mcp.json` or `scripts/` before enabling it.
3. Record the reviewed commit in the table above.
4. Commit as `chore(skills): enable <skill>`.
